# LabVIEW-smooth-interpolation
LabVIEW library that allows smooth filtering and interpolation for a discrete input, even with irregular timing.

The system uses a weighted moving average. It can be used with step inputs (for example the target position of an end effector robotic applications) and it will generate smooth a sinusoidal movement profile, ensuring no harsh spike in demand position. You can also set a velocity cap.
